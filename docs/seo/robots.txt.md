## Robots.txt

The robots.txt file is a text file webmasters create to instruct robots (typically search engine robots) how to crawl pages on their website. The robots.txt file is simply a text file named robots.txt that is placed in the root directory of a website. The robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.

If you wish to edit this file, it's located in `public/robots.txt`. You can read more about the robots.txt file [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro).
