## Styling

We support three different methods for styling your apps:

- [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

During the project creation process, you will be asked to choose a styling method.
