# Internationalization

## Introduction

Next.js has built-in support for [Internationalized Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction). This allows you to localize your routes by adding the locale prefix to the URL pathname or by using a [subdomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain).

By default, DASHâ„¢ is set up to use the path prefix strategy. This means that if you have a page at `/about`, and you want to localize it to French, the page's url would become `/fr-FR/about`.

You can also use a subdomain strategy. This means that if you have a page at `/about`, and you want to localize it to French, the page's url would become `fr-FR.example.com/about` or `example.fr/about`. To use this strategy, you need to set the `localeStrategy` property in `next.config.js` to `subdomain`.

## Adding a locale

To add a new locale, you need to add a new locale code to the `locales` array in `next.config.js`. For example, if you want to add French, you would add `fr-FR` to the array.

```ts
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ["en-US", "nl-NL", "fr-FR"],
    defaultLocale: "en-US",
    localeDetection: true,
  },
};
```

> Note: you can also add locales without a specific region.

## Adding localized routes

The general pattern for localizing routes is by passing the `locale` into the `getStaticPaths` or `getStaticProps` function and then loading the selected locale accordingly. This should then generate a localized route for each locale you have added to the `locales` array. Check out the [Remix Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization#how-does-this-work-with-static-generation) for more information on how this works.
