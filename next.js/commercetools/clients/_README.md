# Commercetools Clients

This directory contains the generated clients for the commercetools platform. Each client serves a different role - from authentication to managing resources.

You may want to edit this configuration, but we've found that this configuration works well for most projects.

> **Note:** The environment variables used in the web client are exposed in the browser and are accessible in the browser's developer tools.
