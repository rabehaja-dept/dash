# Deployment

Because the Next.js version of DASHâ„¢ doesn't require a database, deployment is very simple. You can deploy your app to any cloud platform that supports Node.js. This includes [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), as well as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) - among others.

Below we have our deployment recommendations, but you can also check out the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. It's the easiest way to deploy your Next.js app.

To deploy your app to Vercel, run the following command:

```bash
npx vercel
```

This will create a new Vercel project and deploy your app to it. You can then use the Vercel dashboard to manage your project.

## Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. It's a great option if you want to deploy your app to a CDN.

To deploy your app to Netlify, simply navigate to Netflify and follow the instructions to deploy your app. This usually involves connecting your GitHub account and selecting the repository you want to deploy.
