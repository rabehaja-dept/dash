# E-commerce with Shopify and Sanity

We used [Sanity + Shopify template](https://www.sanity.io/shopify). With this template you can sync your Shopify products to Sanity and use Sanity as a CMS for your Shopify store.

Check out the [make it your own](./customizing.md) documentation to learn how to customize it for your project. Before customizing your stack, you'll need to [move to your own project](./moving-to-your-own-project.md).
