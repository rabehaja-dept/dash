# Commercetools

Commercetools is a headless commerce platform that provides a set of APIs to manage your products, orders, and customers. It is a cloud-based solution that allows you to manage your online store without having to worry about the infrastructure. It's limitlessly flexible, but it takes a bit of work to set up and configure. We've included most of the setup and configuration in this guide to get a basic store up and running.
